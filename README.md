# flaskWebsiteSQL
 
This is a Python Interpreter Website made by using Flask, and sqlalchemy database to make beginner coders feel less confused about coding, and more
comfortable about coding.

You can create an account(a username and a password if they are already not taken), and keep working on your coding projects anytime and anywhere you want.
By coding in the textbox, you can run your code and if there is an error, it will be printed on the website below the textbox.
Each user has a main coding space and an extra 3 different coding spaces on each 3 different html file, so that you can work on different coding projects
at the same time.
You can download your code file to the textbox to keep working on it.
You can save your code to keep working on it later.
